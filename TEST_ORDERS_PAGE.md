# Testing the Orders Page

## Steps to Test the Orders Page Fix

### 1. Run the RLS Policy Fix
```sql
-- Execute the FIX_ORDERS_RLS_POLICIES.sql script in your Supabase SQL editor
-- This will fix the 406 Not Acceptable errors
```

### 2. Test the Orders Page
1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the orders page:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:8080/orders`
   - Or click the Package icon in the header

3. **Check the console for debugging info:**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for these debug messages:
     - "Loading orders for user: [user-id]"
     - "Loaded orders: [array of orders]"
     - "UserOrders render - user: [user object], loading: [boolean], orders: [number]"

### 3. Expected Behavior
- **If user is not logged in:** Should redirect to `/login`
- **If user is logged in:** Should show loading spinner, then either:
  - **Orders found:** Display list of orders
  - **No orders:** Show "No Orders Found" message
  - **Error:** Show error message with retry button

### 4. Debug Information
The page now includes extensive debugging:
- Console logs for user authentication
- Console logs for order loading
- Console logs for render state
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- 10-second timeout to prevent infinite loading

### 5. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Infinite Loading
- **Cause:** RLS policies not properly configured
- **Solution:** Run the FIX_ORDERS_RLS_POLICIES.sql script

#### Issue: 406 Not Acceptable Errors
- **Cause:** Database permissions or RLS policies
- **Solution:** Ensure RLS policies are created and user has proper permissions

#### Issue: Empty Orders List
- **Cause:** No orders exist for the user
- **Solution:** Create a test order first

### 6. Test Order Creation
To test with actual orders:
1. Go to the home page
2. Add items to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Place an order (UPI or COD)
5. Go back to orders page
6. Should see the created order

### 7. Verify Order Details
1. Click "View Details" on any order
2. Modal should open with:
   - Order information
   - Customer details
   - Shipping address
   - Order items with images
   - UPI payment details (if UPI order)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ No 406 errors in console
- ✅ Page loads within 10 seconds
- ✅ Orders display correctly (if any exist)
- ✅ Order details modal works
- ✅ UPI screenshots display (if uploaded)
- ✅ Search and filter functionality works
- ✅ Responsive design works on all devices
