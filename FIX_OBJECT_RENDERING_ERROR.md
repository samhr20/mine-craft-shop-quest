# Fix for "Objects are not valid as a React child" Error

## Issue
The application was throwing `Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys (zip, city, name, phone, state, address, country))` error. This was happening because the code was trying to render address objects directly instead of accessing their individual properties.

## Root Cause
The Order interface was updated to use individual string fields for customer details, but several components were still trying to access the old address object structure:
- `order.shipping_address.name`
- `order.shipping_address.address`
- `order.shipping_address.city`
- etc.

## Components Affected
1. **OrderConfirmation.tsx** - Was trying to render address object properties
2. **AdminOrders.tsx** - Had its own Order interface and was using old address structure
3. **UserOrders.tsx** - Was already updated correctly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed OrderConfirmation.tsx
```typescript
// Before: Trying to access object properties
<p className="font-semibold text-lg">{order.shipping_address.name}</p>
<p>{order.shipping_address.address}</p>
<p>{order.shipping_address.city}, {order.shipping_address.state} {order.shipping_address.zip}</p>
<p>{order.shipping_address.country}</p>
{order.shipping_address.phone && (
  <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Phone: {order.shipping_address.phone}</p>
)}

// After: Using new individual fields
<p className="font-semibold text-lg">{order.customer_name}</p>
<p>{order.shipping_address}</p>
<p>PIN: {order.shipping_pincode}</p>
<p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Phone: {order.customer_phone}</p>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Email: {order.customer_email}</p>
```

### 2. Fixed AdminOrders.tsx Order Interface
```typescript
// Before: Old interface with address objects
interface Order {
  // ...
  shipping_address: any;
  billing_address: any;
  // ...
}

// After: Updated interface with individual fields
interface Order {
  // ...
  shipping_address: string;
  shipping_pincode: string;
  customer_name: string;
  customer_phone: string;
  customer_email: string;
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Fixed AdminOrders.tsx Address Rendering
```typescript
// Before: Trying to access object properties
<span className="font-semibold">{order.shipping_address?.name || 'N/A'}</span>
<span>{order.shipping_address?.city || 'N/A'}, {order.shipping_address?.state || 'N/A'}</span>

// After: Using new individual fields
<span className="font-semibold">{order.customer_name || 'N/A'}</span>
<span>{order.shipping_address || 'N/A'}</span>
```

### 4. Fixed AdminOrders.tsx Search Functionality
```typescript
// Before: Searching in object properties
order.shipping_address?.name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
order.shipping_address?.email?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())

// After: Searching in individual fields
order.customer_name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
order.customer_email?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
```

### 5. Fixed AdminOrders.tsx Copy Details Function
```typescript
// Before: Trying to access object properties
const orderText = `Order #${selectedOrder.order_number}\nCustomer: ${selectedOrder.shipping_address?.name}\nPhone: ${selectedOrder.shipping_address?.phone}\nAddress: ${selectedOrder.shipping_address?.address}, ${selectedOrder.shipping_address?.city}, ${selectedOrder.shipping_address?.state} - ${selectedOrder.shipping_address?.zip}\nTotal: ₹${selectedOrder.total_amount.toFixed(2)}`;

// After: Using new individual fields
const orderText = `Order #${selectedOrder.order_number}\nCustomer: ${selectedOrder.customer_name}\nPhone: ${selectedOrder.customer_phone}\nAddress: ${selectedOrder.shipping_address}, PIN: ${selectedOrder.shipping_pincode}\nTotal: ₹${selectedOrder.total_amount.toFixed(2)}`;
```

## All Fixed Locations

### OrderConfirmation.tsx
- **Line 293**: `order.shipping_address.name` → `order.customer_name`
- **Line 294**: `order.shipping_address.address` → `order.shipping_address`
- **Line 295**: `order.shipping_address.city, state, zip` → `order.shipping_pincode`
- **Line 297**: `order.shipping_address.phone` → `order.customer_phone`
- **Added**: `order.customer_email` display

### AdminOrders.tsx
- **Line 34-50**: Updated Order interface definition
- **Line 105**: `order.shipping_address?.name` → `order.customer_name`
- **Line 106**: `order.shipping_address?.email` → `order.customer_email`
- **Line 404**: `order.shipping_address?.name` → `order.customer_name`
- **Line 408**: `order.shipping_address?.city, state` → `order.shipping_address`
- **Line 641**: `selectedOrder.shipping_address?.name` → `selectedOrder.customer_name`
- **Line 642**: `selectedOrder.shipping_address?.address` → `selectedOrder.shipping_address`
- **Line 643**: `selectedOrder.shipping_address?.city, state` → `selectedOrder.shipping_pincode`
- **Line 644**: `selectedOrder.shipping_address?.zip` → `selectedOrder.shipping_pincode`
- **Line 645**: `selectedOrder.shipping_address?.country` → removed
- **Line 769**: Updated copy details function

## Testing

### Before Fix
- ❌ `Objects are not valid as a React child` error
- ❌ Page crashes when rendering order details
- ❌ Address information not displayed correctly

### After Fix
- ✅ No more object rendering errors
- ✅ Order details display properly
- ✅ Customer information shows correctly
- ✅ Address information displays as strings
- ✅ Search functionality works with new fields

## Expected Behavior

1. **Order List**: Displays customer names and addresses correctly
2. **Order Details**: Shows customer information in modal
3. **Search**: Can search by customer name and email
4. **Copy Details**: Copies correct customer information
5. **Address Display**: Shows address as string with PIN code

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/OrderConfirmation.tsx` - Fixed address object rendering
- `src/pages/AdminOrders.tsx` - Updated interface and fixed all address references

## Result
The "Objects are not valid as a React child" error is now completely resolved. All components properly handle the new Order interface structure with individual customer fields instead of address objects.
